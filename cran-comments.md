## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed dependency on gridExtra, which was not used in this version of the package.
  
## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.1
* win-builder (devel and release)
* travis CI, R 3.3.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs on Windows, OS X, or Linux. The only NOTE was related to the spelling of "Preprocessing", which we believe is correctly spelled.

## Downstream dependencies
The package update does not cause any issues because it does not have any downstream dependencies.
